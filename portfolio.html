						PROJECT: KETEL ONE, PACKAGING 4<br />
						DESIGNER: YENNY YULIANNY, PHOTOGRAPHER: BRANDON SYN<br />
						<br />
						"Ketel One" is a top-shelf vodka from Holland which has been in-production since 1691. In this project I introduced Ketel One in a line of fresh flavors to appeal to a younger audience. The flavors in this line include cucumber, ginger, vanilla, and habanero. The overall design should be very simple and colorful, showing four different kinds of colors based on the flavor of each vodka. This new packaging brings a fresh, young, and contemporary look.

						PROJECT: BENTLEY SKINCARE, PACKAGING 3<br />

						<br />
						Bentley is one of the best automobile companies because it guarantees 100% handmade vehicles. Bentley has now extended its quality of craftsmanship to a new line of skincare products for men. The overall look I have created is bold, clean, as well as classic and contemporary. The Bentley logo, with its clear and frosted matte, brings a depth and contemporary feeling to the bottle.

						PROJECT: JOURNEY BIRDHOUSE, PACKAGING 2<br />
						DESIGNER: YENNY YULIANNY, PHOTOGRAPHER: YENNY YULIANNY<br />
						<br />
						In this project I wanted to incorporate materials that people use everyday and make them into a fun and eye catching birdhouse. This birdhouse, that I call "Journey", is made from recyclable material that we can easily find at home. This birdhouse is like a miniature version from NASA. I designed the Journey birdhouse for educational and inspirational purposes for display in a museum or a classroom setting.

						PROJECT: TERRRA SONOMA, IDENTITY 1<br />
						DESIGNER: YENNY YULIANNY, PHOTOGRAPHER: YENNY YULIANNY<br />
						<br />
						“Terra Sonoma” is an environmentally–conscious food company that grows organic fruit and vegetables on farmlands in Sonoma County, California. Among the products that it is known for are “Verjus”, an unfermented juice made from unripe grapes which are harvested when thinning the vines, and is used as a food product so as not to waste them. The motto of the company is “use only what you need or what you can sell”. The logo that I have created is in green and cream colors to illustrate nature, the environment, and vegetation.

						PROJECT: Creative Madness, TYPOGRAPHY 2<br />
						DESIGNER: YENNY YULIANNY, PHOTOGRAPHER: YENNY YULIANNY<br />
						<br />
						<span>“Creative Madness” is a book that contains the styling from four different artists’ Zelda, Woody Allen, Werner Herzog and Diane Arbus. Typography is used primarily to highlight each artist’s personal life, genius, craziness and creativity. The typography graphics and colors that I used were purposefully chosen to support my concept, giving the viewer a unique impression of the creative madness of each artist. Research and striving to understand the artists and their individual self-expression were of the utmost importance for this project.</span>

						PROJECT: Ocean Waves, TYPOGRAPHY 3 <br />
						DESIGNER: YENNY YULIANNY, PHOTOGRAPHER: YENNY YULIANNY<br />
						<br />
						This is promotional packaging for the relaxation CD “Ocean Waves”. The packaging is made up of three parts; the CD poster, the box set for the CD, and the booklet. The typography design idea comes from the three keywords that represent pure, white, and water. The title letters use embossing as a typographic solution that incorporated in the images, the whole poster, the CD and the booklet. This type creates the landscape or the Ocean Waves image.
